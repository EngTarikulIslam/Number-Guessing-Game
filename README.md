# Number-Guessing-Game
The number guessing game is a game in which we estimate computer generated numbers based on a hypothesis, and if our prediction is  true, we are rewarded and learn how accurate our guess was. We can  improve our guessing skills by playing this game, and eventually, we  will be able to predict anything quite correctly.
